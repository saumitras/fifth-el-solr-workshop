I have a Linux/Ubuntu desktop which has a SATA card. I would actually like to do the same thing for a couple CentOS &amp;amp; FreeBSD boxes at work, and it seems this would have the same solution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've heard that I can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://linux.about.com/od/commands/l/blcmdl1_dd.htm&quot;&gt;DD&lt;/a&gt; to mirror the 40G partition to the 160G drive, or that I can save the 40G partition as an image on my local system, and then copy that 40G image to the 160G drive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Can anyone describe how I may do this?

I would recomend you to read its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=dd&amp;amp;sektion=1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;man page&lt;/a&gt;.

  <row Id="4" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="1" CreationDate="2010-08-10T19:37:16.617" Score="17" Body="&lt;p&gt;Normally I would suggest a solution such as &quot;hook up the 2nd hard drive using an external enclosure, boot from a linux CD, then use a command such as 'dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=1G', but since you want to use the same technique for work, I have what may be a better solution. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of my servers and laptops get imaged at work using &lt;a href=&quot;http://clonezilla.org/&quot;&gt;Clonezilla&lt;/a&gt;. There are two ways of using it...one of which uses a dedicated server and is probably overkill for you, and another which utilizes a boot CD and external hard drive. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The idea is that you boot in with the Clonezilla CD and have a largish (bigger than the source drive) external USB drive. Clonezilla walks you through making an image of the existing drive, after which you power down the machine, replace the drive, then boot back into Clonezilla, and it walks you through restoring the data. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This gives you the opportunity to A) put the image on a bigger drive, and B) retain a backup of the data. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="22" LastActivityDate="2010-08-10T19:37:16.617" />
